The aim of `taxlist` is to provide an object structure for taxonomic lists, as
well as functions for handling and displaying the information contained in such
objects.
The structure of `taxlist` objects is inspired on data handled by
[Turboveg](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg) and on relational
database models.

2018](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.6.e23635)).

The functions in this package has being used to structure and clean data stored
in [SWEA-Dataveg](https://kamapu.github.io/sweadataveg.html), a vegetation-plot
database for Eastern Africa.

## Installing taxlist

This package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (**CRAN**)
and can be directly installed in an R-session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("taxlist", dependencies=TRUE)
```

Alternatively, the current development version is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kamapu/taxlist) and can be installed using the
package `devtools`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/taxlist", build_vignette=TRUE)
```


## Building taxlist Objects

Objects can be built step-by-step as in this example taking as reference the
"Ferns of Chile" (original in Spanish: "Helechos de Chile") by **Gunkel
(1984)**.
The first step will be to generate an empty `taxlist` object:

```{r}
library(taxlist)

Fern <- new("taxlist")
summary(Fern)
```

We start defining the required taxonomic ranks. In such case, the levels have to
be provided from the lowest to highest hierarchical level:

```{r}
levels(Fern) <- c("variety","species","genus")
```

For convenience, we start inserting taxa with their respective names in a
top-down direction. We use then the function `add_concept()` to add a new
taxon. Note that the arguments `TaxonName`, `AuthorName`, and `Level` are
used to provide the name of the taxon, the authority of the name and the
taxonomic rank, respectively.

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern, TaxonName="Asplenium", AuthorName="L.", Level="genus")
summary(Fern, "all")
```

As you see, the inserted genus got the concept ID **1** (see `TaxonConceptID`
in the previous figure).
To insert a species of this genus, we use again the function `add_concept()`,
but this time we will also provide the ID of the parent taxon with the argument
`Parent`.

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern, TaxonName="Asplenium obliquum", AuthorName="Forster",
	Level="species", Parent=1)
summary(Fern, "Asplenium obliquum")
```

In the same way, we can add now two varieties of the inserted species:

```{r}
Fern <- add_concept(Fern,
	TaxonName=c("Asplenium obliquum var. sphenoides",
		"Asplenium obliquum var. chondrophyllum"),
	AuthorName=c("(Kunze) Espinosa",
		"(Bertero apud Colla) C. Christense & C. Skottsberg"),
	Level="variety", Parent=c(2,2))
```

You may have realized that the function `summary()` is applied to provide on
the one side a display of meta-information for the `taxlist` object, and on the
other side to show a detail of the taxa included in the object. In the later
case adding the keyword `"all"` in the second argument will show all the
handled taxa.

```{r}
summary(Fern)

summary(Fern, "all")
```


## Similar Packages

The package `taxlist` shares similar objectives than the package
[`taxa`](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa), but sing different approaches for
object oriented programming in **R**, namely `taxlist` uses S4 while `taxa`
uses R6. Additionally, `taxa` is rather developer-oriented, while
`taxlist` is rather user-oriented.

In following cases you may prefer to use `taxlist`:

- In the case that you like to handle taxonomic lists including parent-child
  relationships and synonymy, especially when you need an automatic check on
  the consistency of this information (i.e. using the function
  `validObject()`) or when the information have to be re-arranged during a
  session.
- When you foresee statistical assessments on taxonomy diversity or taxon
  properties (chorology, conservation status, functional traits, etc.).
- When you seek to produce documents using **rmarkdown**, for instance guide
  books or check-lists. Also in article manuscripts taxonomic names referring
  to a taxon concept can be easily formatted by the function `print_name()`.
- When importing taxonomic lists from databases stored in
  [**Turboveg 2**](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg).
- When you seek to implement the package
  [`vegtable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegtable) on handling and
  assessing biodiversity records, especially vegetation-plot data. In that
  case, taxonomic lists will be formatted as a `taxlist` object.


## Rmarkdown Integration

As mentioned before, `taxlist` objects can be also used for writing rmarkdown
documents (see [this poster](https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36713.90728)).
For instance you can insert your objects at the beginning of the document with a
hidden chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(taxlist)
data(Easplist)
```
````

To mention a taxon, you can write in-line codes, such as
<code>&grave;r print_name(Easplist, 206)&grave;</code>, which will insert
`r print_name(Easplist, 206)` in your document (note that the number is the ID
of the taxon concept in `Easplist`).
Fort a second mention of the same species, you can then use
<code>&grave;r print_name(Easplist, 206, second_mention=TRUE)&grave;</code>,
which will insert `r print_name(Easplist, 206, second_mention=TRUE)` in your
text.


## Descriptive Statistics

Information located in the slot **taxonTraits** are suitable for statistical
assessments.
For instance, in the installed object `Easplist` a column called
**lf_behn_2018** includes a classification of macrophytes into different life
forms.
To know the frequency of these life forms in the `Easplist`, we can use the
function `count_taxa()`:

```{r}
# how man taxa in 'Easplist'
count_taxa(Easplist)

# frequency of life forms
count_taxa(~ lf_behn_2018, Easplist)
```

Furthermore, taxonomic information can be also transferred to this slot using
the function `tax2traits()`.
By this way we will make taxonomic ranks suitable for frequency calculations.

```{r}
Easplist <- tax2traits(Easplist, get_names=TRUE)
head(Easplist@taxonTraits)
```

Note that the respective parental ranks are inserted in the table
**taxonTraits**, which contains the attributes of the taxa.
In the two next command lines, we will produce a subset with only members of
the family Cyperaceae and then calculate the frequency of species per genera.

```{r}
Cype <- subset(Easplist, family == "Cyperaceae", slot="taxonTraits")
Cype_stat <- count_taxa(species ~ genus, Cype)
```

Now, we can sort them to produce a nice bar plot.

```{r genera_bar}
Cype_stat <- Cype_stat[order(Cype_stat$species_count, decreasing=TRUE),]

par(las=2, mar=c(10,3,1,1))
with(Cype_stat, barplot(species_count, names.arg=genus))
```
