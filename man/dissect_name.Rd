\title{Dissect Scientific Names into their Elements}
\usage{
dissect_name(x, split = " ", fixed = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector containing taxon names.}

\item{split, fixed, ...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[base]{strsplit}}.}
}
\value{
A character matrix with as many rows as names in the input vector.
}
\description{
Depending the degree of resolution and specific roles of nomenclature,
strings containing taxon usage names (scientific names) are constructed with
different parts.
A string with names can be consequently split into those elements, meanwhile
the number of elements will suggest the taxonomic ranks.
}
\details{
This function is using \code{\link[base]{strsplit}} for splitting names.
Single spaces will be used to dissect names but it can be changed in the
value of argument `split`.
The number of columns in the resulting matrix will depend on the longest
polynomial string.
